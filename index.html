              <h4>Humanoid Robot</h4>
              <div class="categories">Robotics Project</div>
              <br>
              <p>
                Humanoid Robot is the main project of the Ichiro ITS robotics team.
                There are 2 kinds of robots in this project,
                the first one called Arata which plays in the kid-size category,
                and the second one called Ithaaro which plays in the teen-size category.
                But aside from the difference in which category the robot played,
                both robots were built using the same electronics components
                and ran using the same programs.
                <br><br>
                We use the robots mainly to compete
                in RoboCup that is held by the RoboCup Federation
                and FIRA RoboWorld Cup that is held by
                the Federation of International Robot-soccer Association.
                Both competitions have the same objective
                to make humanoid robots from around the world
                compete and complete challenges in
                athletics like soccer, sprint, weightlifting, etc.
                <br><br>
                In this project, I and other programmers in my team
                are challenged to create a program for the robots
                such that it could complete challenges
                as fast and as accurately as possible.
                To accomplish those challenges,
                we need to develop many things in the robot's program,
                including developing an object detection system
                so the robots could detect balls and obstacles in the field,
                Developing a walking control system so the robot
                could walk smoothly without slipping and falling, etc.

              <h4>Surabaya 2048</h4>
              <div class="categories">Game Project</div>
              <br>
              <p>
                Surabaya 2048 is a puzzle game,
                inspired by the 2048 game,
                with Surabaya landmarks as the numbered blocks.
                I developed this game with my friend
                as part of the task to become the B201 Lab's assistant.
                <br><br>
                Just like the 2048 game,
                the main task of this game is to merge blocks
                with the same type so it would be upgraded to the higher type
                and reach the highest score as high as possible
                while we could still move the blocks.
                This game also features many landmarks of Surabaya
                in voxel design like Heroes Monument, Bungkul Park, Suramadu Bridge, etc.
                <br><br>
                This game was built using the Unity game engine.
                I simply just do the programming part like
                making the game system, user interfaces, and score systems,
                While my friend designs the landmarks models.
                The game itself was done in just 2 weeks,
                as the game itself is simple and does not require much coding.

                MAGE 5, also known as Multimedia and Game Event 5,
                is a Computer's Engineering event that consists of
                competition in App/Game Developing, E-Sport, Talkshow, etc.
                The website itself is mainly used for both
                event information and dashboard site for both admins and users.
                <br><br>
                In this project, I do not handle much in the programming side.
                Instead, I lead the other programmer to create a website
                that could accommodate the needs of this event
                from the backend side to the frontend side.
                The website itself was mainly built using
                the Laravel framework that handles the server-side of the website.
                <br><br>
                This website was active from June to December 2019.
                But sadly the event was already ended and the website already closed,
                but I could give more detail of this project
                from the official Instagram account of this event.

              <div class="categories">Game Project</div>
              <br>
              <p>
                Golden Age: Nusantara is a turn-based strategy game
                inspired by indie game Predynastic Egypt with
                some Civilization Series elements like
                hex-based tiles and technology tree system.
                The main objective of this game is to develop
                a newly created Majapahit capital city of Trowulan
                and spread the Majapahit sphere of influence across Nusantara
                either by trade or invasion.
                <br><br>
                This game was developed with two of my friends
                as part to compete in a game development competition
                that was held by Multimedia and Game Event 2018.
                In this project, I handle all the programming side
                from developing the game system
                to developing the player interaction with the game,
                while two of my friends create the assets
                like 3d models and user interface designs.
                <br><br>
                This project could be considered hard and complex
                because aside from just creating a game design
                that already exists previously,
                we need to develop a game with a fresh design
                while making sure it is still fun to be played.
                Also, because this game at the end will be deployed to the mobile platform,
                we were challenged to optimize this game
                so it could still be played on all kinds of smartphone platforms,
                from low tier to the high tier.

              <br>
              <p>
                Robot Monitoring System is a monitoring software
                that is used to aid the debugging process
                of the Ichiro ITS robotics team humanoid robot's programs.
                In the humanoid robot competition,
                especially the soccer competition,
                multiple robots need to communicate with each other
                and collaborate in the field to score the goal.
                That is why this software is created to aid the debugging process
                of that collaboration part of the program.
                <br><br>
                This software works by capturing UDP packets sent by each robot
                that tells the state, position, and direction of the robot.
                This software was developed using C++ with OpenFrameworks
                for the graphical user interfaces and networking framework.
                This software was done in less than a month
                and considered easy to be made as the software
                just needed to capture the data sent by each robot and display it to the screen.
